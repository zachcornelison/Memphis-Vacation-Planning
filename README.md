# Memphis-Vacation-Planning
This project is for the final project requirement in the Coursera IBM Professional Data Science course.
After learning how to work with Foursquare location data, the task of this final project is to leverage location data to explore a geographical location. 

As a current resident of downtown Memphis, I have personally had many friends and relatives come to visit the city for anywhere from a day to a week. I often struggle to suggest an itenary, so I figured I could work to solve this problem now by utiziling the kMeans clustering algorithm, combined with venue location data, to explore hot spots around the city to create an itenerary given a duration of stay for a visitor. 

I will run the algorithm three times with three different numbers of clusters (3, 5, 7) each representing the number of days a guest might stay in town. This theorhetical guest will be staying at the popular Peabody Hotel in downtown Memphis, from which I will derive the top nearby venues to explore. 

This folder contains the Jupyter notebook I performed all of my analysis in, as well as all of the Folium map visualizations that did not properly render when being uploaded to Github.
